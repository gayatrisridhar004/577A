# SRAM Project - USC EE 577 A
## Lab 4 part A
### By - Gayatri Sridhar
1) Introduction: In this lab I designed and verification of a 512-bit SRAM array which is comprised of 4 banks (8x16 each). In addition the peripheral circuitry- consisting row decoder, precharge network, Sense amplifier, Column mux and output registers - were also designed. This repository covers the design details specifucations, critical timing analysis and simulation reports.
The following image gives the architecture of the 512-bit SRAM:
